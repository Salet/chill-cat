An increasing number of nutrition-savvy veterinarians, including board-certified veterinary internists, are now strongly recommending the feeding of canned food instead of dry kibble.

The three key negative issues associated with dry food are:
1) water content is too low
2) carbohydrate load is too high
3) type of protein – too high in plant-based versus animal-based proteins

In addition, dry food is very heavily processed which includes being subjected to high temperatures for a long time resulting in alteration and destruction of nutrients.

Dry food is also often contaminated with bacteria, fungal mycotoxins, storage mites/cockroaches and their feces, etc.

Most people who are concerned about their own nutrition have heard nutritionists say “shop the perimeter of the grocery store.”  This statement refers to the push to get humans to focus on fresh food – not overly processed food found in boxes and cans.

## What Do Cats Eat?

Cats are obligate carnivores, in other words, meat eaters. “Cats really thrive when part of their diet comes from animal sources,” explains Purina Senior Nutritionist Jan Dempsey. Some protein-rich foods cats like to eat are:

* Salmon
* Trout
* Herring
* Mackerel

## How Much, How Often?

Most cats will eat their main meals at dawn and dusk, when they would normally be hunting and catching prey in the wild, so those are often the best times to feed them.

How much your kitty should get in their bowl depends on their age, size, and how active they are, but the average is about 200 calories per day. It’s a good idea to ask your veterinary team to help you calculate your cat’s needs. Pay careful attention to the calorie counts on all foods you give to your cat, Churchill says. “The calorie count can vary significantly from food to food.” 

Cats will also nibble during the day if you leave food sitting out, but be aware: They aren’t good judges of how much they should eat.
