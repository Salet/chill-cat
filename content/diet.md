# Diet

In general, use canned food instead of dry food. Dry food has too little water.

## What Do Cats Eat?

Cats are carnivores, in other words, meat eaters. Some protein-rich foods cats like to eat are:

- Salmon
- Trout
- Herring
- Mackerel

## How Much, How Often?

Most cats will eat their main meals at dawn and dusk. How much a cat eats depends on their age, size, and how active they are, but the average is about **200** calories per day.
