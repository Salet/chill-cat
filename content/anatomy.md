## Mouth

Cats have highly specialized teeth for killing prey and tearing meat. The premolar and first molar, together called the carnassial pair, are located on each side of the mouth. These teeth efficiently function to shear meat like a pair of scissors. While this feature is present in canids, it is highly developed in felines.

## Ears

Thirty-two individual muscles in each ear allow for a kind of directional hearing;[1] a cat can move each ear independently of the other. Because of this mobility, a cat can move its body in one direction and point its ears in another direction. Most cats have straight ears pointing upward. Unlike with dogs, flap-eared breeds are extremely rare (Scottish Folds have one such exceptional mutation). When angry or frightened, a cat will lay back its ears to accompany the growling or hissing sounds it makes. Cats also turn their ears back when they are playing or to listen to a sound coming from behind them. The fold of skin forming a pouch on the lower posterior part of the ear, known as Henry's pocket, is usually prominent in a cat's ear.[2] Its function is unknown, though it may assist in filtering sounds.

## How Cats Breathe?

The respiratory system includes the mouth and nose, trachea, lungs and smaller airways.

The respiratory system is responsible for taking in oxygen and eliminating waste gases like carbon dioxide. Because dogs and cats do not sweat through the skin, the respiratory system also plays an important role in regulation of temperature.

## How Long do cats live?

The feline life expectancy is 10 to 15 years. Cats who spend significant unsupervised time outdoors tend to survive to be about 7 years old, while indoor-only cats can be expected to live to around 14 years of age.

## How big are cats?

Not that big, but they can get up to 10kg if you feed them too much! If any cat reaches over 10kg of mass, it is required by law to refer to it as "chonker".
