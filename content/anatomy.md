# Mouth

Cats have highly specialized teeth for killing prey and tearing meat. The premolar and first molar, together called the carnassial pair, are located on each side of the mouth. These teeth efficiently function to shear meat like a pair of scissors. While this feature is present in canids, it is highly developed in felines. 

## Ears 

Thirty-two individual muscles in each ear allow for a kind of directional hearing;[1] a cat can move each ear independently of the other. Because of this mobility, a cat can move its body in one direction and point its ears in another direction. Most cats have straight ears pointing upward. Unlike with dogs, flap-eared breeds are extremely rare (Scottish Folds have one such exceptional mutation). When angry or frightened, a cat will lay back its ears to accompany the growling or hissing sounds it makes. Cats also turn their ears back when they are playing or to listen to a sound coming from behind them. The fold of skin forming a pouch on the lower posterior part of the ear, known as Henry's pocket, is usually prominent in a cat's ear.[2] Its function is unknown, though it may assist in filtering sounds.

## How Cats Breathe?

The respiratory system includes the

* Mouth and Nose
* Trachea
* Lungs and Smaller Airways (bronchi and bronchioles)

The respiratory system is responsible for taking in oxygen and eliminating waste gases like carbon dioxide. Because dogs and cats do not sweat through the skin, the respiratory system also plays an important role in regulation of temperature.

## How Long do cats live?

The feline life expectancy that is quoted in reference texts varies, but a good, average figure is 10 to 15 years. Another statistic that veterinarians commonly use in practice is the following:

Cats who spend significant unsupervised time outdoors tend to survive to be about 7 years old, while indoor-only cats can be expected to live to around 14 years of age.

## How big are cats?

**Kitten**: Less than 6 months old

Soft Paws will fit most kittens by the time they reach the age of 16 weeks (4 months). Some kittens can wear them as early as age 12 weeks (3 months) . To test, try a nail cap on first without the adhesive. If it looks too big, don't glue it on. The nail cap should fit snugly, like a glove.

To accommodate smaller kittens, you can trim the base (open end) of the Soft Paws nail cap, making it smaller so it will fit your kitten's nail.

Kittens up to about 5 pounds and 5 months of age generally fit the kitten size. Some kittens at 5 months may need the small size rather than the kitten size if they are growing fast or are large-breed cats.

**Small**: Approximately 6 months old / Approximately 6-8 pounds

In general, the small-sized Soft PawsÂ® will fit cats that are approximately 6 months of age and about 6-8 pounds.

Small-boned adult cats may wear the small size. If your cat seems smaller than an average full-grown cat, choose small.

**Medium**: Approximately 9-13 pounds

Most adult average size cats wear medium.

**Large**: Approximately 14 pounds and up

Very large-boned and large-breed cats wear large. Maine Coons, for example, are very large cats and generally wear large.
