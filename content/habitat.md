## Where do cats live?

Cats are able to adapt. This means a cat can easily live in a forest, desert, and in a city.

Cats enjoy when there are many places to hide in their surroundings, like small caves, tree bushes, etc. This makes them feel safe. The chill cat particularly enjoys hanging out on a bed or a sofa.

## Where in the world can you find a cat?

Cats exist in many countries and live on all continents except for Antarctica.

## I saw a cat in the wild, I wanted to pet it but it ran away. What's up with that?

A wild cat is called a feral cat. They are born in the wild or outdoors with little to no human interaction and that's why they're scared of you.
