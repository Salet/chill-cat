          <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
            Despite being specifically adapted to hunt for food, domestic cats will usually take
            advantage of alternative food sources that may be available, such as food found through
            scavenging or in the case of pet cats, food that is provided for them by their owners.

            Cats do not defend themselves with their teeth. They defend themselves with their claws.
            A declawed cat is really a club-footed animal. The cat cannot walk normally as he must
            move with his weight on the rear of his pads.

            being one of the most important ones. Here is a cool video explaing cat's sleeping
